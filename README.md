# Binary Classifier for MNIST

This repository contains solutions to exercises on implementing a binary classifier for MNIST dataset using PyTorch.

## Files

1. **`layered_model.py`**: Contains functions to define dense models, train the models for single digit classification, and evaluate their performance.

## Exercise Details

### Overview

In this exercise, you will implement a binary classifier to classify a single number from the MNIST dataset. The objectives include defining dense models with single and hidden layers, training the models, and evaluating their performance.

### Functions to Implement

1. **`define_dense_model_single_layer`**: Define a dense model with a single layer.
2. **`define_dense_model_with_hidden_layer`**: Define a dense model with a hidden layer.
3. **`fit_mnist_model_single_digit`**: Train the model for a single digit classification.
4. **`evaluate_mnist_model_single_digit`**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model.
